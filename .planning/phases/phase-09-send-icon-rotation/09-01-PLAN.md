# Plan 09-01: Send Icon Rotation

## Objective

Rotate the send icon in the chat input 90 degrees clockwise so it points to the right instead of upward.

## Execution Context

- **Phase**: 9 - Send Icon Rotation
- **Milestone**: 3 - Chat Panel Visual Enhancements
- **Depends on**: Phase 8 (Input Box Polish) - Complete
- **Scope**: XS (single CSS rule)

## Context

### Current State
- The CopilotKit send icon is an upward-pointing arrow (SVG path: `M12 19V5m0 0l-7 7m7-7l7 7`)
- The icon is rendered inside a button with class `copilotKitInputControlButton`
- When in "send" mode, the button has `aria-label="Send"`
- The project already uses CSS overrides in `src/index.css` for CopilotKit styling

### Target State
- The send icon should be rotated 90 degrees clockwise (pointing right)
- This transforms the upward arrow into a "send/submit" arrow pointing right

### Technical Approach
Two options were considered:

1. **CSS Transform (Recommended)**: Add a CSS rule to rotate the SVG inside the send button
   - Pros: Simple, consistent with existing CopilotKit CSS override patterns
   - Cons: Requires careful selector to target only the send button

2. **Icons Prop**: Pass a custom rotated icon via CopilotChat `icons={{ sendIcon: ... }}`
   - Pros: More explicit, no CSS specificity concerns
   - Cons: Requires creating a custom React component, more code

The CSS approach is recommended because:
- It follows the established pattern in this codebase (see other CopilotKit overrides in index.css)
- It's a minimal change (single CSS rule)
- The existing icon is already well-designed, just needs rotation

### Selector Strategy
The send button can be targeted using:
- `.copilotKitInputControlButton[aria-label="Send"] svg` - Most specific, targets only the send button

## Tasks

### Task 1: Add CSS rule to rotate send icon
**File**: `/Users/neileverette/Desktop/generative-ui-prototype/src/index.css`

Add the following CSS rule after the existing input box styles (around line 325):

```css
/* Rotate send icon 90 degrees clockwise - transforms upward arrow to rightward arrow */
.copilotKitInputControlButton[aria-label="Send"] svg {
  transform: rotate(90deg);
}
```

### Task 2: Verify the change
1. Run `npm run build` to ensure no build errors
2. Visually verify the send icon is rotated correctly (pointing right)
3. Verify the icon reverts to stop icon during message processing (no rotation on stop icon)

## Verification

### Automated
- [x] `npm run build` passes with no errors
- [x] No TypeScript errors

### Manual
- [ ] Send icon points to the right (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
- [ ] Stop icon appears unchanged during message generation
- [ ] Disabled state appearance is correct (muted color when input is empty)

## Success Criteria

1. The send icon in the chat input is rotated 90 degrees clockwise
2. The icon now points to the right instead of upward
3. Build passes with no errors
4. Other input control buttons (stop, push-to-talk) are unaffected

## Output

- Modified file: `/Users/neileverette/Desktop/generative-ui-prototype/src/index.css`
- New CSS rule for send icon rotation
